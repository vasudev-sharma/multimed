DisCeRn: Disease-Contrastive Representations from Multi-Modal Medical Data
===

## About

We propose DisCeRn: Disease-Contrastive Representations from Multi-Modal Medical Data, a method for modifying contrastive loss by weighting negative pair of samples differently based on marginally related observed pathologies. The detailed project report and presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/tomginsberg/multimed/blob/master/ML4H_Project_Report%20.pdf) and [here](https://csc2541hf-2021.github.io/project_presentations/CSC2541_VahidBalazadeh_TomGinsberg_KorbinianKoch_VasudevSharma_ProjectPresentation.pdf) respectively. This project is done in part of course [CSC2541: ML in Healthcare](https://csc2541hf-2021.github.io/)
