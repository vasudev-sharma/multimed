DisCeRn: Disease-Contrastive Representations from Multi-Modal Medical Data
===

## About

We propose DisCeRn: Disease-Contrastive Representations from Multi-Modal Medical Data, a method for modifying contrastive loss by weighting negative pair of samples differently based on marginally related observed pathologies. The detailed project report can be found [here](https://github.com/tomginsberg/multimed/blob/master/ML4H_Project_Report%20.pdf). This project is done in part of course [CSC2541: ML in Healthcare](https://csc2541hf-2021.github.io/)
